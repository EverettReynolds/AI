Algorithm Analysis

The algorithm for the Artificial Algorithm Genetic Algorithm will go as follows
The command line will be used to determine what kind of simulation is ran.
python3 artlife.py will be typed by the user
If there is a -f with a valid file name attached, a custom template will be made.
Otherwise a default board will be made with randomized cells filled in.
After it is determined where the board is coming from, the user will be asked how many generations
Then, once that number is determined, there will be that many simulations ran.
A simulation starts with the printing of the game board so the user knows what their initial board is
The board will then go through a check for neighbor cells to update to the new board
The board will go through a new conditions check method which determines whether all the previous cells are still alive or not
Then, the board will be printed out again.
The board will continue to go through this cycle over and over again until all desired simulations have been gone through
The objective of all of this is to simulate the fitness of a population of hypothetical cells, which need certain conditions to live on
There are some issues with it, such as the ability to horizontally print within Python being very difficult.
To mitigate this problem somewhat, a counter is placed next to each cell when printed out so that it is easier to track the population within a non grid style.
