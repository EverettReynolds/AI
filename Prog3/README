Algorithm Analysis

My algorithm for the Eliza Chatbot will work as such
I will use the optional main def to be the main orchastrator of the entire program
Within this I will have input for the user's name so that Eliza has access to it
I will then give a greeting to the user and say that the session has begun
Using a while True loop,
I will get the user's response to my therapy questions
There will be a search through the user sentence for any of the phrases which would constitute an exit
If the user does not have any of those phrases, we will go to the parse method
This will parse through the sentence using a for loop and look for a match with the sentence given and the sentence database that I have made
If one is found, the sentence will have its output recorded for Eliza 
Then, it will have its pronouns swapped to fit the description of Eliza saying it
This sentence will then be returned to the main method and outputted to screen where the user is reprompted to continue their conversion with Eliza
If a exit word is found, Eliza will say a goodbye and exit the entire program

My dialog class is built into the eliza class as it is simply a python list
This Python List is filled with entries for every possible outcome of a sentence a user could say
A default option is also set.
Each option has multiple responses which can be chosen.
These can be referenced used indices within the list, as it is two dimensional in nature (I believe)
My algorithm does not have many efficency issues, but could be made more efficent through the use of quick sorting algorithms and actual searches taking place
